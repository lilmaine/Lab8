Robot Maze


Using the code created in the previous labs, this lab focuses on navigating a robot through a maze. 

Requirements
You must write a program that autonomously navigates your robot through a maze (Figure 1) while meeting the following requirements:

Your robot must always start at the home position.
Your robot is considered successful only if it finds one of the three exits and moves partially out of the maze.
A large portion of your grade depends on which door you exit.
Door 1 - Required Functionality
Door 2 - B Functionality
Door 3 - A Functionality
You cannot hit a wall!
Bonus! Navigate from the A door back to the entrance using the same algorithm.
You cannot hit a wall!
Your robot must solve the maze in less than three minutes.
Your robot will be stopped if it touches the wall more than twice.
Your robot must use the IR sensors to find its path through the maze.

Documentation: C2C Noel Nicolas walked me through most of this lab after I struggled.
